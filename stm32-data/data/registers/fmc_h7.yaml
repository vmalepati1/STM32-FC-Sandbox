The FMC features a FIFO that is used when writing to memories to transfer up to 16 words of data.This is used to quickly write to the FIFO and free the AXI bus for transactions to peripherals other than the FMC, while the FMC is draining its FIFO into the memory. One of these register bits indicates the status of the FIFO, for ECC purposes.The ECC is calculated while the data are written to the memory. To read the correct ECC, the software must consequently wait until the FIFO is empty."

When the CPU reads/writes the data from a NAND Flash memory page at the correct address (refer to Section20.8.6: Computation of the error correction code (ECC) in NAND Flash memory), the data read/written from/to the NAND Flash memory are processed automatically by the ECC computation module. When X bytes have been read (according to the ECCPS field in the FMC_PCR registers), the CPU must read the computed ECC value from the FMC_ECC registers. It then verifies if these computed parity data are the same as the parity value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR register should be cleared after being read by setting the ECCEN bit to 0. To compute a new data block, the ECCEN bit must be set to 1."

It corresponds to a COUNT value of 0000111000000 (448). This 13-bit field is loaded into a timer which is decremented using the SDRAM clock. This timer generates a refresh pulse when zero is reached. The COUNT value must be set at least to 41 SDRAM clock cycles.As soon as the FMC_SDRTR register is programmed, the timer starts counting. If the value programmed in the register is 0, no refresh is carried out. This register must not be reprogrammed after the initialization procedure to avoid modifying the refresh rate.Each time a refresh pulse is generated, this 13-bit COUNT field is reloaded into the counter.If a memory access is in progress, the Auto-refresh request is delayed. However, if the memory access and Auto-refresh requests are generated simultaneously, the Auto-refresh takes precedence. If the memory access occurs during a refresh operation, the request is buffered to be processed when the refresh is complete.This register is common to SDRAM bank 1 and bank 2."
